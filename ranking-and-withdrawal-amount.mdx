title: "Ranking and Withdrawal Amount"

**<u>Why do I see changes in my ranking and my withdrawable amount?</u>**

Mapper ranking is determined by your overall contribution across three key activities:

- **Creating content**
- **Staking in content**
- **Affiliate performance** (bringing in friends and new users)

Your ranking reflects your expected earnings for the upcoming withdrawal date and is directly affected by your expected withdrawable amount. 

The withdrawable amount displayed in the app shows exactly what you’ll be able to withdraw at your next withdrawal date. This amount updates continuously based on your activity in the three metrics above, as well as fluctuations in the token’s value.

Mappers who consistently create high-quality content, stake early in valuable memories, grow real communities, and avoid manipulative behavior will rank higher and increase their profits.
