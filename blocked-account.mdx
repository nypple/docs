**<u>How do I know if my account is blocked?</u>**

If you are unable to perform any of the following actions, it is possible that your account has been temporarily blocked:

- Upload content
- Stake
- Redeem earnings (staking profit or creator profit)

If this happens, please contact our support team at [**support@collectivememory.ai**](mailto:support@collectivememory.ai) and include the following details:

- Your **full name** and **country**
- Your **account ID** or **wallet address**
- A **screenshot of the error** as it appears on your end

Our team will review your account and assist you.

**<u>What are the possible reasons for account blocking?</u>**

If your account has been blocked recently, it may be due to one or more of the following reasons:

- Manufacturing non-genuine content
- Excessive spamming activity
- Excessive cross-staking between multiple accounts
- Harassing other user/s within the app

These behaviors do not add value to the ecosystem and may negatively impact the platform’s fairness and overall quality. When such activity is detected, it may result in **fund deductions** and/or **account blocking**.

If any of the reasons above are unclear, or if you believe your account was blocked, please contact our support team at [**support@collectivememory.ai**](mailto:support@collectivememory.ai).
