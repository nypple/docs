**<u>I successfully withdrew ATTN - what’s next?</u>**

**Check Your Balance**\

**Wallet \> ATTN – Attention Token** (under **TOKENS**).

**Decide What to Do Next**\
You can either:

- **Keep the ATTN token** in your wallet, or
- **Swap it to USDC** if you want to sell it for cash.

Before deciding, we recommend reading about the ATTN token and its potential on our relevant  [blog post](https://docs.collectivememory.ai/guides/attention-as-currency).

**<u>How to Swap Your ATTN to USDC?</u>**

There are a few ways to swap ATTN to USDC within the Collective Memory (CM) app:

### **Option 1: Swap and Send Using the CM App**

1. Go to Wallet \> SWAP \> Swap ATTN to USDC.
2. After swapping, you can send the USDC to an external wallet or another swapping app:\
   Wallet \> TRANSFER \> Send.

### **Option 2: Use an External Wallet App**

1. Export your CM wallet to an external wallet (e.g., Base, Uniswap):\
   Wallet \> GET KEYS \> Settings \> Account & Security \> Recovery Phrase.
2. Using the unique Recovery Phrase \> Import your wallet into the external app and perform swaps there.

**⚠️ Important: Never share your unique Recovery Phrase with anyone!**

### **Selling USDC for Cash**

Once you have USDC, you can sell it on external services such as Binance P2P, Transak, Bybit, and others.

### **Key Notes and Safety Tips**

- Do not send ATTN directly to an external wallet (e.g., Binance). Always swap to USDC first.
- If it’s your first time, test transactions with a small amount (around \$5–10 USD) to avoid errors.
