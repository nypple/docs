**<u>What is cross-staking and why is it harmful to the ecosystem?</u>**

Cross-staking occurs when a group of users repeatedly stakes on the same creator’s content in a coordinated or repetitive way, regardless of the content’s quality or uniqueness.

This type of behavior is considered a form of manipulation, as it can artificially inflate staking activity and reduce fairness across the platform.

Practices such as cross-staking, spamming, fake content, repetitive content, and other similar behaviors do not add value to the ecosystem and may negatively impact its overall quality and integrity.

When such activity is detected, it may result in **fund deductions**, **withdrawal-related errors**, and/or **account blocking**.

**<u>What is spamming and why is it harmful to the ecosystem?</u>**

Spamming refers to repeatedly uploading content that provides little or no value to the platform. Spam content can include:

- Fake or non-genuine content
- Content captured from a screen
- Unclear or irrelevant uploads
- Low-quality or repetitive content

Practices such as spamming, fake content, and other forms of manipulation do not contribute to the ecosystem and may negatively impact the platform’s fairness and overall quality.

When such activity is detected, it may result in **fund deductions**, **withdrawal-related errors**, and/or **account blocking**.
