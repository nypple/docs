## 1. Introduction

The **ATTN token** is the native currency of the **Collective Memory Protocol** - a decentralized social and economic layer where users create and curate Memories (time-stamped, geo-anchored content). ATTN powers staking, governance, incentives, and monetization across the ecosystem.

## 2. Token Overview

**Name:** Attention Token (ATTN)\
**Standard:** ERC-20 (Base)\
**Address:** 0x032a7252B4932c44bdE89AEE6275744376a96BFF\
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ATTN\
**Initial Price:** 1 ATTN = 0.01 USDC\
**Decimals:** 6

## 3. Token Utility

ATTN is designed to capture and monetize attention within the Collective Memory ecosystem. \
\
Core utilities:

- **Signaling Importance:** Users stake ATTN into Memories, signaling importance and receiving Memory Tokens.
- **Creator Rewards:** Creators earn ATTN from Memory staking and direct tips.
- **Revenue Distribution:** ATTN funds Memory revenue pots, rewarding stakers.
- **Advertising Boosts:** Brands inject ATTN into Memories to reach audiences.
- **Governance (future):** Token holders will participate in protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.
- **Data Licensing (future):** ATTN is the medium of exchange for accessing the Reality Graph (decentralized, verified dataset).

## 4. Token Allocation

| **Category**      | **Share** | **Amount**  | **Cliff** | **Vesting Schedule**   | **Initial Unlock** |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :---------- | :-------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- |
| Company           | 10%       | 100,000,000 | 1 yr      | 3 yrs linear           | 0%                 |
| Team              | 10%       | 100,000,000 | 1 yr      | 3 yrs linear           | 0%                 |
| Backers           | 25%       | 250,000,000 | 1 yr      | 2 yrs linear           | 0%                 |
| Initial Liquidity | 10%       | 100,000,000 | 0         | –                      | 100%               |
| Grants            | 10%       | 100,000,000 | 0         | 10 yrs inverse sigmoid | 20%                |
| Incentives        | 35%       | 350,000,000 | 0         | 10 yrs inverse sigmoid | 20%                |

## 5. Emission Schedule

- **Inflationary Supply:** Ongoing emissions offset by ATTN locking in Memories.
- **Daily Airdrops:** 300,000 ATTN/day to curated Memories (decays annually).
- **Event Rewards:**
  - Memory of the Day: 50,000 ATTN
  - Memory of the Week: 100,000 ATTN
  - Memory of the Month: 250,000 ATTN
  - Memory of the Year: 10,000,000 ATTN

## 6. Staking & Redemption Mechanics

When staking into a Memory:

- **70%** → Principal Pot (redeemable on exit)
- **25%** → Revenue Pot (shared among Memory Token holders)
- **5%** → Creator Pot (direct reward; staker also receives creator tokens)

Upon redemption:

- User retrieves their **70% principal**
- Plus **pro-rata share** of the Revenue Pot
- Memory Tokens are **burned**

## 7. Protocol Revenue Model

**Core Fees**

- **0.1%** on staking
- **0.25%** on redemption
- **0.5%** on creator withdrawals

\
**Liquidity Pools**

- **0.3%** fee on AMM swaps (ATTN, Memory Tokens, USDC)

\
**Extended Revenue Streams**

- **Advertising Integration** – ATTN injections by brands
- **Reality Graph Licensing** – access to anonymized/aggregated Memories
- **On-Chain AI Fee Sharing** – protocol-to-protocol revenue with AI systems
- **Private Graphs** – enterprise deployments (supply chain, events, analytics)

## 8. Governance

- **Current:** Protocol-controlled via company’s multisig.
- **Future:** ATTN holders will vote on treasury spending, grant allocations, fee parameters, and protocol upgrades.

## 9. Demand Drivers & Token Sinks

**Demand Drivers:**

- Staking into Memories (visibility + ownership)
- Creator incentives
- Advertising spend
- AI/data licensing demand

**Sinks / Locks:**

- ATTN staked into Memories (locked until redemption)
- Publishing fees (spam deterrence, refunded if Memory gains traction)

## 10. Composability

- **ERC-20 ATTN:** Standard fungible token.
- **ERC-4626 Memory Vaults:** Each Memory functions as a tokenized vault with shares.
- **Composable Memories:** Memories can be backed by other Memories’ tokens → meta-narratives, ETFs, or recursive curation.
- **Inter-Memory Liquidity:** Memory tokens trade via AMMs, creating narrative-driven price signals.

## 11. Market & Liquidity Strategy

_Initial_ Liquidity (10%) allocated for CEX/DEX pools.

**ATTN \<\> USDC (on Base)**

- Address: 0xf90bd5415e8c812cb9a2015598193dcb11833d7c

- 55M ATTN tokens
- Min price: 0.00000352238 ETH
- Max price: 0.00034 ETH
- Liquidity locked until 1st January 2027

- Goal: ensure seamless swaps between ATTN ↔ USDC and ATTN ↔ Memory Tokens.

## 12. Risk Disclosures

- **Smart Contract Risk:** Bugs or exploits in staking/redemption contracts.
- **Market Risk:** Token price volatility and liquidity risks.
- **Concentration Risk:** Early backers/treasury may hold large shares.
- **Regulatory Risk:** Token classification subject to jurisdictional laws.
- **Inflation Risk:** Ongoing emissions, though offset by locked ATTN and burn mechanics.

## 13. Adoption & Current Traction

- **\>1.6M Memories posted** across iOS, Android, Web.
- **10x higher content production** vs. traditional social platforms.
- Verified coverage of conflict zones, live events, cultural phenomena.
- Growing base of creators, curators, and advertisers.

## 14. Closing Vision

ATTN is not just a token - it’s the **currency of attention and reality perception**. By embedding incentives, staking, and composable mechanics into social and cultural participation, ATTN turns reality itself into an economic layer for decentralized AI and human knowledge.
