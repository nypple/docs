## **Should I participate in the Daily Challenges?**

Yes! Participating in Collective Memory Daily Challenges is one of the best ways to accumulate ATTN and increase visibility for both your account and your content.

This is especially recommended for new users. Even if you don’t win the challenge, participating can significantly increase awareness and engagement around your memories.

## **How do I participate in a Daily Challenge?**

1. Start by posting a **text memory** that includes the relevant hashtag (#) of the challenge.
2. Upload content that fits the challenge theme. This can be:
   - An image
   - A video
   - One memory or multiple memories

### **Please make sure to:**

- Include the correct hashtag (#) in your post together with the relevant content.
- Upload the challenge content shortly after posting the hashtag, so the connection between them is clear.
- Be creative — while keeping the content clearly aligned with the challenge topic.

## **What do I receive if I win a Daily Challenge?**

If you win a Daily Challenge, your memory is credited with a **revenue injection**.

Injected memories benefit from a double positive effect:

1. **Direct Profit Boost** – The injection itself is typically substantial and increases the memory’s profitability.
2. **Maximum Exposure** – Injected memories receive the highest level of visibility in the system, encouraging more users to stake on them.

After your memory is injected and receives additional staking, you can redeem your creator funds — increasing your overall profits.
