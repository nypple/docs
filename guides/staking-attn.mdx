## What is ATTN?

ATTN (Attention) is the digital currency of Collective Memory.

- You earn it when people stake in your Memories.
- You can stake it in other posts to grow your balance.
- You can also buy ATTN on our website, and cash out \
  by swapping ATTN → USDC → your bank or card.

## Why do people stake?

- To give exposure: the more ATTN in a Memory, the more visible it becomes. Current and trending Memories live in the Hot feed.
- To make money: if a Memory gains traction, your stake can grow with it.
- To reward creators: a share of every stake goes straight to the creator.

## How do Memories increase in value?

- More people join in: every new stake adds ATTN to the Memory’s revenue pot, which is shared proportionally among all stakers.
- Revenue injections: brands or sponsors can inject ATTN into a Memory to boost its reach (for example via bots like Rev-Bot). That ATTN flows to Revenue and to the creator.

## Why should you stake too?

- Grow your ATTN by spotting and staking in strong Memories before they blow up.
- Shape the feed. Staking is how you decide what the world sees.
- Give ATTN, get attention. Creators can see who stakes in them, which helps you build relationships across the network.

## Tips to get started

- Turn notifications on. You will see when you get ATTN, when important events break, and when new challenges drop.
- Hunt the New feed. Catch good content early; the earlier you join, the more chance to profit.
- Ride the wave. When you notice a trend forming, double down on related content.
