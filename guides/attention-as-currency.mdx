title: "ATTN Token: Attention Becomes Currency"
description: "By nature, importance is created when people focus on something together. Online, big corporations interfere with that flow, building walls that decide what should matter and what should not. ATTN is modeled to restore that natural order. It turns attention into a tradable asset, so you can invest your attention in what matters to you. When you hold and stake ATTN, you are holding a piece of the world’s collective focus. As stories and ideas attract more attention, their value inside the system grows. "

**What makes ATTN different?**

Every post on the platform is a **Memory** - raw, time-stamped, geo-anchored, and immutable. It might be a DJ set in Berlin, frontline footage from Gaza, or anything in between. When you stake ATTN in a Memory, you’re not liking it. You’re backing it.

- The more ATTN a Memory gets, the more visible it becomes.
- You earn a cut of its future growth.
- The creator gets a fee instantly.

It’s a simple but radical shift: _attention becomes value_.

### **Why hold ATTN?**

ATTN is the backbone of a living economy.

- **It has real demand.** Creators earn in ATTN. Advertisers inject ATTN to reach the exact audiences inside live cultural moments. Even AI systems license Collective Memory’s “Reality Graph”, a dataset of verified human experience, and they pay in ATTN to do it.
- **It scales with culture.** Over 1.6 million Memories have already been posted, from protests to recipes to underground parties. Every one of them proves this isn’t theory. It’s already alive.
- **It’s capped.** Only 1 billion ATTN tokens will ever exist. As more creators, curators, advertisers, and AI systems plug into Collective Memory, demand for ATTN rises — but supply does not. Growth of the network means growth of the token’s value.

There will only ever be one billion ATTN tokens. Every post, stake, and ad on Collective Memory requires them. As the system grows, demand rises, supply stays fixed, and value compounds into the token. ATTN is for people who see the long game — intellectuals who understand that attention has always been the foundation of culture, and now it’s finally captured as an asset.
