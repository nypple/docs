title: "Attention, Trust, and the ATTN Token"
description: "ATTN is a new way to value what people pay attention to and trust. It powers Collective Memory - our network where people share real memories and highlight what truly matters."

## Intro

The foundations of human interaction are **attention** and **trust**. Every day, we exchange attention: we give it, we earn it, and through that exchange, we decide who and what truly matters. When something or someone captures our attention and proves to be genuine, trust is built, and we reserve our long-term attention for the people and information we trust.

**Collective Memory** is built on that same foundation. **ATTN** is the currency of this network - a way to measure how much attention and trust something deserves. Here, people document their reality, give and receive attention, and bring visibility to what truly matters.

## ATTN Can Become Our Generation’s Bitcoin

Think back to Bitcoin’s early days: it began as a small experiment in digital money that anyone could own. It was built on two simple principles:

1. **Scarcity:** There would only ever be a fixed amount. No company, government, or developer could create more. People understood that scarcity gives something lasting value.
2. **Decentralization:** No single authority could control it.

The **Attention Token (ATTN)** follows the same principles. It powers Collective Memory - a system where human attention becomes measurable and tradable.

## Scarcity via Fixed Supply

There will only ever be one billion ATTN, and that number will never change - not by the team, not by investors, not by anyone. Whenever ATTN is used to stake or boost a Memory, it stays within a closed ecosystem. The network can grow endlessly - more users, more Memories, more demand - but the supply of ATTN stays the same. When something is limited but demand increases, its value naturally rises. **Holding ATTN means holding a piece of that growth.**

## Decentralization: No Central Control

No one can take your ATTN or decide how much your Memories are worth. Everything operates in a decentralized, community-driven way. The rules are transparent, public, and hard to change.

## Why Holding ATTN Matters

Collective Memory is built by its users. Each new Memory, each new participant, increases the system’s activity. As more people join, more ATTN is locked into Memories, leaving less in circulation for others - users, brands, and institutions alike.

When people hold ATTN instead of selling it, they signal confidence that its value will grow. This strengthens the internal economy and brings more users. Growth becomes a shared outcome - when the network expands, the token grows with it. And when the community holds, the network can expand faster.

## The Future of Attention

As the system evolves, new layers of use will emerge. Each new use adds demand to the same fixed pool of one billion ATTN:

- **AI systems** will rely on verified human data from Collective Memory to understand reality. They will need ATTN to access it.
- **Brands** will use ATTN to connect with real people through real stories and a non-intrusive presence - not through outdated advertising systems.

## To Summarize

ATTN is built on attention and trust - with real utility and real-world value. The value of ATTN doesn’t come from speculation; it comes from participation. Everyone who documents, stakes, and holds contributes to the system’s strength and stability. This isn’t a zero-sum game where winners take from losers; value flows in from advertisers and AI companies that need access to Collective Memory to better understand reality - not by selling data, but by sharing value.

This is a long-term economy, built not on hype but on human behavior. If you’re looking for a short-term money grab, this isn’t for you. If you want to help build the cornerstone of a new internet - based on attention, trust, and, above all, humans - we want you on board.
