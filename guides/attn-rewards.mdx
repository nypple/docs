Collective Memory is built for long-term value creation - where everyone‚Äôs efforts compound over time. \
\
But we also want contributors to enjoy part of that value today.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve introduced a multi-tier Liquid ATTN withdrawal system - a fair, transparent way for active contributors to unlock part of their earned rewards regularly, while keeping the majority as a long-term stake in the project‚Äôs success.

## **üß≠ How It Works**

Each month, you **earn locked ATTN** based on your contributions and community impact.\

\
This ATTN goes into your **vault**, where it grows as a **long-term savings balance** - representing your share in the ecosystem‚Äôs expanding value.

Every 30 days, you can withdraw a portion of your ATTN into your wallet as **liquid tokens** - tradable, usable, and convertible to USDC (cash).

Your **withdrawal tier** determines how much you can unlock each cycle.\
Tiers are **updated daily** based on your performance, engagement, and community recognition.

## **üèÜ The ATTN Tier System**

| **Tier**       | **Rank Range** | **Liquid ATTN Withdrawal (per 30 days)** |
| :------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Elite**      | Top 20         | 50,000 ATTN                              |
| **Pro**        | Top 50         | 20,000 ATTN                              |
| **Top**        | Top 100        | 10,000 ATTN                              |
| **Solid**      | Top 500        | 1,000 ATTN                               |
| **All Others** | Everyone else  | Locked ATTN with future upside           |

Your rank can change daily - so consistent effort keeps you higher in the tiers.\
Withdrawals happen once every 30 days, based on your tier at the time of withdrawal.

## **üíß Your Liquid ATTN**

You always have ways to **access immediate value**:

- Now: The ATTN you withdraw every 30 days based on your tier
- Soon: Any ATTN you buy on the open market
- Soon: Any ATTN you earn from creator fees on challenge wins or competition rewards

Everything else remains locked - growing in value as the ecosystem strengthens.\
This balance between liquid and locked ATTN keeps the token‚Äôs economy healthy and sustainable.

## **üìà How ATTN Gains Value**

ATTN is publicly traded, primarily in **Uniswap liquidity pools**.\
 Liquidity drives the price:

- **More liquidity ‚Üí higher price**
- **Less liquidity ‚Üí lower price**

The system is designed so that as liquidity grows, **the value of ATTN increases automatically**.\
 For example:

| **USDC Liquidity** | **Token Price (USDC/ATTN)** |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 0                  | 0.010                       |
| 100K               | 0.0124                      |
| 300K               | 0.018                       |
| 500K               | 0.0246                      |
| 700K               | 0.0322                      |
| 1M                 | 0.0456                      |

If liquidity reaches \$1M - which is not guaranteed and depends on the platform‚Äôs overall success - ATTN is expected to be worth about five times its initial value, increasing from 0.01 to 0.05 USDC.

## **üíé Should You Hold or Sell?**

That‚Äôs entirely your choice - but here‚Äôs how we see it: We hold.

Why? Because ATTN represents ownership in the ecosystem‚Äôs growth.\
As liquidity and adoption increase, the value of each ATTN token rises.\
Selling early might give you short-term gains - but holding aligns you with the long-term upside of the entire community.

We believe in what we‚Äôre building, in the creators who power it, and in the collective growth of everyone holding ATTN. So while you can cash out at any time, the real value lies in the long game.

## **üåç Why This System Benefits You**

1. You have access to liquid value
2. You‚Äôre rewarded more the more you contribute
3. Your long-term upside scales with ecosystem success
4. The token‚Äôs health and stability are protected
5. You control your progress through your effort

Your creativity and belief are the foundation of Collective Memory.\
Every ATTN you earn connects your personal growth to the success of the entire network.

The more you contribute - and the longer you hold - the greater your upside.\
When the ecosystem grows, you grow.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**

ATTN is a publicly traded token whose price depends on market liquidity and community participation. Like any asset, its value can go up or down - and in extreme cases, it could even fall to zero. There are no guarantees of financial gain.

The goal of the ecosystem is to reward contribution and collective growth, not speculation.\
Always make your own informed decisions, participate responsibly, and remember:\
The real value of ATTN lies in the creativity and collaboration it enables.
