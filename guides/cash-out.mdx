title: "How to Cash Out "
description: "ATTN can be converted to USDC anytime. Converting your USDC to cash in your bank or credit/debit card involves 3rd party providers. In this article we’ll cover all you need to know about the whole process end to end.  Please note: if you have zero crypto experience (“normie”) this might seem complex, but once you’ll do it for the first time - it becomes quick and easy. The main challenge is to pick a solution that suits your region, but that’s a thing with any crypto."

### Step 2 - Convert ATTN to USDC

1. Log in at [**collectivememory.ai**](http://collectivememory.ai)
2. Go to **Wallet** → select **ATTN ↔ USDC**
3. Choose **ATTN → USDC**
4. Enter the amount and confirm the swap.

Your balance will now show in USDC.

_Note: You may need a small amount of Base ETH for gas fees (around \$2 covers many transfers) We initially provide you with the gas fees to complete swaps._

### \
Step 3 - Transfer your USDC to an external wallet or exchange & cash out.

Once you hold USDC, send it to exchanges or fiat gateways that support your region. From this point, the process is handled by third-party providers.\
\
Log in (again, if needed) at [**collectivememory.ai**](http://collectivememory.ai)

2. Go to **Wallet** → select **Transfer**
3. Enter the wallet address you got from the solution you found in Step 2
4. Enter the amount of USDC you would like to send.
5. Click "Send" and wait for the transaction to complete

Now go back to the solution you found, and continue with their instructions on how to cash out the USDC you just transferred. \
\
\
**Important**

Collective Memory only supports the **ATTN → USDC** conversion. Off-ramping to your local currency is managed by external providers. Always test first with a small transfer (\$10–15).

### **Coming Soon**

You’ll soon be able to send USDC directly to off-ramp providers from inside the **Collective Memory app**, simplifying the entire process.

### **Final Note**

While cashing out is available, we recommend holding ATTN. The more the system grows, the more value concentrates in the token. This game is long term — those who hold are best positioned to benefit from the expansion of Collective Memory.
