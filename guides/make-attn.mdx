title: "How You Make ATTN"
description: "ATTN is earned by adding real value to the Collective Memory ecosystem. Every action that captures authentic attention strengthens the network - and rewards you for it."
---

You make ATTN through three core pathways:

### **1. Capturing Attention-Worthy Memories**

Create and upload meaningful, high-quality Memories - the ones that resonate, inspire, or spark curiosity. When your Memories attract genuine engagement from the community, you earn ATTN. The more people interact with what you create, the more value you generate - and the more ATTN flows your way.

### **2. Investing ATTN in Promising Memories**

Use your ATTN wisely by investing early in Memories you believe will gain attention over time.\
This transforms Collective Memory into a prediction market of reality - where insight and intuition are rewarded. If a Memory you backed attracts significant attention later, your early support pays off with increased ATTN rewards.

### **3. Inviting Great People**

Growth happens through connection.\
When you invite interesting, talented users, you earn affiliation fees from their success.\
The more active and impactful your invitees become, the more ATTN you generate through their contributions.

### **4. Buying ATTN Directly**

You can also purchase ATTN directly through public liquidity pools like Uniswap.\
Buying ATTN is more than a transaction - it‚Äôs an investment in the ecosystem itself.\
As liquidity grows, the price of ATTN rises automatically, increasing the long-term value of your holdings. Early buyers help strengthen the ecosystem‚Äôs foundation ‚Äî and are positioned to benefit most as adoption expands.

### **üö´ What Doesn‚Äôt Work**

Not every action earns ATTN - and that‚Äôs by design.\
The system rewards real participation and value, not noise.

Attempts to game the system -

- Uploading thousands of meaningless Memories
- Fake memories / screenshots / copycats
- Using bots or manipulation tactics
- Engaging in spam or dishonest behavior
- simply don‚Äôt work.

Such actions generate no ATTN, and can lead to permanent blocking from the platform.

### **üí° The Principle**

Collective Memory thrives on authenticity, creativity, and trust.\
Every ATTN token reflects real human attention, not artificial activity.\
The more you contribute genuine value - the more the system rewards you in return.

**Earn ATTN by creating, discovering, and empowering what truly matters.**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**

ATTN is a publicly traded token whose price depends on market liquidity and community participation. Like any asset, its value can go up or down - and in extreme cases, it could even fall to zero. There are no guarantees of financial gain.

The goal of the ecosystem is to reward contribution and collective growth, not speculation.\
Always make your own informed decisions, participate responsibly, and remember:\
The real value of ATTN lies in the creativity and collaboration it enables.
