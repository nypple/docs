title: "ATTN withdrawals explained"
---

**Introduction**\
Our platform is growing fast - as you’ve probably noticed. More users, more memories, more staking. We’ve added revenue bots, new rewards, and a referral system, creating more opportunities than ever to earn ATTN and build real value by mapping reality.

To support this rapid growth, we need to carefully balance the economy between all types of users - creators and stakers, new members and early adopters. Our goal is that within a year, withdrawing ATTN will be completely unlimited and traded on the open market.

**Withdrawals** \
Withdrawals are currently limited to 20,000 ATTN per month for users. This structure is designed to create long term value by focusing on network growth while still allowing short term cashouts.\
\
As the system expands, limits will gradually increase. Our goal is to completely remove withdrawal limits within a year, as liquidity, user base, and overall system stability continue growing together. 

**The ATTN pool**\
Withdrawals come from a shared ATTN pool, which is refilled twice a week - every Monday and Thursday. Because Collective Memory is growing fast, this pool may run out before the next refill. When that happens, users may temporarily see withdrawal delays until the next refill cycle. 

Gradually distributing Attention ensures stability as demand increases, protecting both users and the token economy. The intention is simple - sustainable growth, shared value, and a stable economy for everyone building the future of Collective Memory.
