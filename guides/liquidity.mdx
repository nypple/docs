title: "How ATTN Price Works;  Understanding liquidity and pools."
description: "ATTN powers the Collective Memory ecosystem. Its price isn’t set by hidden factors - it’s determined automatically by the liquidity in ATTN pools.  "

## When users, investors, licensors, or advertisers buy ATTN to use within the platform, they add liquidity, and the price rises. In other words, ATTN’s price reflects the value created in Collective Memory: the memories, the usage, and the attention they generate.\
\
 It’s simple: \
\
More meaningful Memories → More user attention → More value for investors, advertisers, and AI data consumers → They buy ATTN to participate → ATTN rises → Creators and Stakers earn more → the flywheel spins.

## **What are liquidity pools?**

A liquidity pool is a shared reserve of tokens that allows people to trade instantly. The pool already holds both sides of the trade (for example, ATTN and USDC) so users can swap one token for another at any time.

## **How the Pools Shape Price**

ATTN trades in two main Uniswap pools: ATTN–USDC and ATTN–ETH. Together they hold 10% of the entire supply, locked across defined price ranges. Within those ranges, the pools adjust price based on the balance of assets inside them.

 Example: When someone buys ATTN, they put USDC into the pool and get ATTN in exchange. As the pool holds less ATTN at the current price, it automatically goes up to the next price level. If someone sells ATTN, the opposite happens and the price adjusts downward.

Because liquidity in these pools is locked for years, the pricing behavior remains consistent and free from intervention.

## **Your ATTN are worth more as more liquidity is added:**

## **Where Demand Comes From**

ATTN demand comes from actual activity in the ecosystem:

1. **Advertisers** buy ATTN to boost Memories and reach precise audiences. 
2. **AI companies** will use ATTN to license Collective Memory’s dataset. 
3. **Users** buy ATTN to stake in Memories and participate more deeply.
4. **Crypto traders** add liquidity and volume by trading ATTN like any other token.

Most of this demand comes from utility, not speculation.

## **Keeping the Community Informed**

Whenever someone adds a significant amount of liquidity - usually by making a large ATTN purchase - the community is notified. This helps everyone stay aware of major shifts in liquidity and reflects real interest from new participants. These updates are informational and neutral, not promotional.

## Why Growing Collective Memory Helps Price

The more attention the platform attracts, the more valuable ATTN becomes. More users add more Memories. More Memories lead to more staking and more creator activity. That, in turn, attracts advertisers and AI partners - both of whom must buy ATTN to participate. Their buying adds liquidity to the pools, naturally pushing the price upward.

This isn’t a pump cycle. It’s a usage cycle. The healthier the platform becomes, the more demand flows into ATTN.

## A Long-Term, Transparent System

ATTN is built for long-term participation. As more Memories are posted, more ATTN is staked, more advertisers join, and more AI licensing occurs, the market continuously adjusts the token’s price based on real demand.

> ## There are no shortcuts or artificial mechanisms. ATTN’s price simply reflects the growth and activity of the ecosystem around it.

## **Clear roadmap - we just need to execute - together.**

Our goals are simple: to make Collective Memory the most interesting, up-to-date platform for global awareness, capturing everything happening around the world, genuine and verified. We believe this data asset will become one of the most valuable information sources for both humans and AI. As we continue adding value through usage and high-quality information, investors, advertisers, and licensors will join - because they’ll need to.

Together, by creating more attention-worthy Memories, staking ATTN on what matters, spreading the word, and bringing in more users, we’ll drive more value into the system.

At **\$50K liquidity**, ATTN is worth ~**\$0.01**\
At **\$100K liquidity**, ATTN is worth ~**\$0.0125**\
At **\$0.5M liquidity**, ATTN is worth ~**\$0.025**\
At **\$1M liquidity**, ATTN is worth ~**\$0.05** (that’s **5×** the starting point!)\
At **\$100M**, ATTN = ~\*\*\$1 ****(estimated)At \$1B, ATTN = ~****\$10 \*\*(estimated)

How much will the ATTN you hold be worth at each milestone?\
**Let’s make it happen.**
